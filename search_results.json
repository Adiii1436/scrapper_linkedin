But let's consider another angle.\n\nBehind the scenes, talent acquisition teams are tirelessly working to bridge the gap between organizations and job seekers. It's no small feat. Coordinating schedules between busy business teams and eager candidates takes time and effort, especially when juggling multiple appointments.\n\nYet, amidst this tedious process of scheduling, there's a simple courtesy often overlooked: communication.\n\nIt's understandable that candidates may have second thoughts or unforeseen circumstances arise.\nInstead of completely disappearing and not showing up, a simple notification of withdrawal can save the recruiter's valuable time.\n\nIn a world where time is of the essence and connections are key, let's strive for transparency and mutual respect in the recruitment process. After all, it's not just about finding the right fit for the role, but also fostering a culture of professionalism and consideration.\n\nSo, let's pledge to keep the lines of communication open, honoring the efforts on both sides of the hiring equation. Together, we can elevate the recruitment experience for everyone involved.",

      "description": "Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai announced exciting news for developers and Cloud customers today. The Gemini API in AI Studio and in Vertex AI is now available for building with 1.0 Ultra and the next generation, Gemini 1.5.\n\nGemini 1.5 is a significant breakthrough in long-context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet, running up to 1 million tokens consistently. This breakthrough will enable entirely new capabilities for developers and help them build much more useful models and applications.\n\nWith safety at the core, Google teams are making rapid progress in pushing the frontiers of their latest models. Gemini 1.5 shows dramatic improvements across a number of dimensions and 1.5 Pro achieves comparable quality to 1.0 Ultra while using less compute.\n\nWe're excited to offer a limited preview of this experimental feature to developers and enterprise customers. Demis shares more on capabilities, safety, and availability in the link below.",
